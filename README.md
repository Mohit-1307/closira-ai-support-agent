# 🧠 Core Features

## 1️⃣ SOP-Based FAQ Answering

The assistant answers customer questions strictly using predefined SOP data.

### Example

```text
Customer: What are your Botox prices?

AI: Our Botox prices start from £200.
```

### Safety Measures

- No hallucinated responses
- No unsupported claims
- SOP-grounded responses only
- Escalation instead of guessing

---

## 2️⃣ Lead Qualification

The assistant collects structured lead information during conversations.

### Questions Asked

- What type of business are you in?
- How large is your team?
- What tools are you currently using?

### Example Output

```text
Lead Details:
- Business Type: Healthcare
- Team Size: 20
- Current Tools: WhatsApp
```

---

## 3️⃣ Escalation Detection

The workflow automatically escalates conversations under risky or unsupported conditions.

### Escalation Triggers

| Trigger | Action |
|---|---|
| Out-of-scope query | Escalate |
| Complaint/anger | Escalate |
| Medical advice request | Escalate |
| Pricing negotiation | Escalate |
| Explicit human request | Escalate |

### Example

```text
AI: I could not find that information in our policy documents.
I will escalate this to a human representative.

[ESCALATION TRIGGERED]
Reason: Out-of-scope question
```

---

## 4️⃣ Conversation Summary Generation

At the end of each interaction, the system generates a structured summary.

### Example

```text
==============================
Conversation Summary
==============================

Customer Intent:
Customer asked about Botox pricing and booking.

Lead Details:
- Business Type: Healthcare
- Team Size: 20
- Current Tools: WhatsApp

Escalation Status:

Recommended Next Action:
